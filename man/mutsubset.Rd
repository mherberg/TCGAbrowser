\title{mutsubset function}
\usage{
mutsubset(pat, rna, mut, gene)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene}{character(1) A gene to subset the mutation data}

\item{mae}{MultiAssayExperiment object containing a simplifed Mutation assay generated from `qreduceTCGA`, must have assay with "Mutation" in the name}
}
\value{
Returns a MultiAssayExperiment object with an assay called Cohort that labels the samples according to "mutated" and "wild-type" for the gene of interest
}
\description{
Adds an assay called Cohort to a MultiAssayExperiment object to indicate which samples are mutated or wild-type for a gene of interest.
